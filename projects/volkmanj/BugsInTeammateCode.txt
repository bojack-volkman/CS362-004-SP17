Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
Affected Version: Mary Jacobsen’s assignment 2 submission
File name: dominion.c
Environment: Windows 10 Pro, Eclipse Java EE, GCC C Compiler, flip.oregonstate.edu

Description: The number of actions that a player had after playing a village card is incorrect. It appears to be the negative of what it is supposed to be. 

Code causing Bug:
playVillage function has a ‘-‘ operator instead of a ‘+’ operator where the function is supposed to add 2 to the number of player actions remaining.

Suggested Fix:
Change the ‘-‘ operator to a ‘+’ operator.

Bug 2
Title: Smithy card adds incorrect number of cards to hand

Created: 5/27/2017
Updated: N/A
Resolved: N/A
Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
Affected Version: Mary Jacobsen’s assignment 2 submission
File name: dominion.c
Environment: Windows 10 Pro, Eclipse Java EE, GCC C Compiler, flip.oregonstate.edu
Description: The number of cards that a player is supposed to draw when Smithy is played is 3 cards. It appear that the number of cards actually drawn is 2 cards.

Code causing Bug:
playSmithy function has an iterative loop that draws cards from the deck. The counter of this loop executes for numbers 0 and 1. That is 1 iteration less than required to draw 3 cards.

Suggested Fix:
Change the ‘<’ operator in the counter condition to ‘<=’ to add 1 more iteration and draw another card.

Bug 3
Title: Adventurer card often results in segmentation fault when 2 treasures are drawn.

Type: Bug
Status: Open
Priority: Major
Resolution: Not resolved
Affected Version: Mary Jacobsen’s assignment 2 submission
File name: dominion.c
Environment: Windows 10 Pro, Eclipse Java EE, GCC C Compiler, flip.oregonstate.edu
Description: Occasionally, the program will encounter a segmentation fault when the number of treasures drawn from an Adventurer card is equal to 2.

Code causing Bug:
playAdventurer function receives a drawn treasure count of 2. The counter ‘z’ is incremented when a treasure is not drawn. ‘z’ is used as an index for accessing the array temphand[z-1] in a while loop that executes z-1 times. When z contains a value of 0, the program attempts to access temphand[-1] which cannot exist.

Suggested Fix:
Change the ‘>=’ operator in the while loop condition to ‘>’ to reduce the loop by 1 iteration and prevent the segmentation fault.
